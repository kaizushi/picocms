=== Things to change in future edits ===

The big:
* Make it detect the Linux disribution and webserver in use to render the site.
	This will use the webservers version string, and maybe someone else has
	code for checking what Linux distro is in use.
* Turn the guides feature into a subpages feature.
	This will allow one to include directories of subpages and work much like
	the guides functionality and be morphed from its code. This will then mean
	one basically has different content-types and these subpages go on their
	respective listings not the menus at the top of pages.
* Create a parser so one can declare with a new picosite syntax for using BBCode
	instead of HTML to write pages. This makes it less of a learning curve.
	Also one should be able to write a template in BBCode for all the pages.

The small:
* Make it so one can make blogs use access time or creation time
* Check everything actually is optional like I say.
* Create a setting for the base currency symbol.
