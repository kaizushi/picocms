=== Things to change in future edits ===

The big:
* Make it detect the Linux disribution and webserver in use to render the site.
	This will use the webservers version string, and maybe someone else has
	code for checking what Linux distro is in use.
* Turn the guides feature into a subpages feature.
	The subpages system exists and the guides will be morphed into this code.
	However the guides will have special filenames and I am not quite sure yet
	how I am going to hack it so it uses printSubpage() to do it. Since the
	printSubpage() method uses getFileName() it could feed it the guide file
	name instead of a subpage. Easy way would be IFs.
* Create a parser so one can declare with a new picosite syntax for using BBCode
	instead of HTML to write pages. This makes it less of a learning curve.
	Also one should be able to write a template in BBCode for all the pages.

The small:
* Make it so one can name to main language of the site
* Make it so one can make blogs use access time or creation time
* Check everything actually is optional like I say.
