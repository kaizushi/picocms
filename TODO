=== Things to change in future edits ===

The big:
* Make it detect the Linux disribution and webserver in use to render the site.
	This will use the webservers version string, and maybe someone else has
	code for checking what Linux distro is in use.

The small:
* Not require itemlist-old.txt
* Not print old prices whe itemlist-old.txt doesn't exist.
* Check everything actually is optional like I say.
* Create a setting for the base currency symbol.
