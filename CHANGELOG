The 28th of October 2019:
	* I have made the source code release not metion Kaizushi's Little Onion Server.
	* I have made it so picosite only displays old prices if a file for them exists.
The 2nd of November 2019:
	* Created a branch for working on the big feature subpage.
	* I have added a subpage feature but not tested it.
	* Subpage feature required a change to the 404 system, also the 404 page in a
	  file was inconsistent with other ways 404s would be done.
	* Traced each call to getPageFile and put a 404 after for each print method
	  and made informative 404s about what kind of file is missing.
	* I have removed a bunch of debugout calls
	* Now there one can set the currency symbol and this means one can use any
	  language as long as getprice.php is using it.

	* I have implemented the picosite picocall for subpages and wrote the infra-
	  structure for it. It seems to work, and picosite has been changed quite a
	  lot so now this branch is being moved into fiddling.
	  [THIS HAS BEEN MERGED FOR UNIT TESTING INTO FIDDLING]

	* While doing subpages I have changed a lot of methods and reduced if statement
	  by making an empty string that is set if a language is selected.
	* I removed some redundant functions and took out their calls.
	* Made it obvious where one sets the base currency in getprices.php with a global.
The 18th of November 2019:
	* Tested so features are not active without picocodes enabling them.
	* One can set the primary language as a config
	* One can now click on the site logo to go back to the main page and this
	  generates the path, and if an alternate language is passed then it
	  makes a link including it.
The 19th of November 2019:
	* We have added template.php and changed page.php, so that if the template
	  exists, the inbuilt template is disabled. Keep in mind the promise and
	  principle that page.php works solo.
	* The logo image can be clicked on taking one back to the main page for a
	  particular language, if one is selected.
The 23rd of November 2019:
	* It now does not show anything in menus and such, when a translation for
	  a file does not exist.
	* Some changes to the template so it includes a call to print a domains
	  list after languages.
The 28th of November 2019:
	* The domains method was writing HTTPS in its link, now it is just HTTP
	  which should be fine if there is a redirect to HTTPS.
