<p>We accept Bitcoin & Monero donations and we wash out Bitcoin with non-custodial swap services. This means you can send us filthy and dirty Bitcoin without putting us at risk.

<p>We also accept Monero donations and this network has lower fees. If you are a greedy drug capitalist (no offense, I love you) you should do business with it.

<p>If you you yourself wash your BTC with XMR, and must cash out with BTC take heed: if the BTC amounts are similar in a small amount of time it may stand out still. As such donating a random amount of XMR midway can change that amount.
